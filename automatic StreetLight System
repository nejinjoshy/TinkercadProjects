AUTOMATIC STREETLIGHT SYSTEM USING ARDUINO UNO

The Automatic Streetlight System using Arduino Uno is a project designed to enhance energy efficiency and promote safety on the streets. By utilizing Arduino Uno, the system automatically detects ambient light levels and activates or deactivates streetlights accordingly. It employs light sensors to measure the intensity of surrounding light, triggering the Arduino Uno to control the streetlights. This smart system not only eliminates the need for manual intervention but also reduces energy consumption by ensuring streetlights are only operational when required. With its automated functionality, this project contributes to the development of sustainable and cost-effective urban lighting solutions.
