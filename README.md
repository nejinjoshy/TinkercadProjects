# **Project 1:AUTOMATIC STREETLIGHT SYSTEM USING ARDUINO UNO**
The Automatic Streetlight System using Arduino Uno is a project designed to enhance energy efficiency and promote safety on the streets. By utilizing Arduino Uno, the system automatically detects ambient light levels and activates or deactivates streetlights accordingly. It employs light sensors to measure the intensity of surrounding light, triggering the Arduino Uno to control the streetlights. This smart system not only eliminates the need for manual intervention but also reduces energy consumption by ensuring streetlights are only operational when required. With its automated functionality, this project contributes to the development of sustainable and cost-effective urban lighting solutions.

This image shows the daytime situation.During daytime, the Automatic Streetlight System using Arduino Uno detects the high ambient light levels through the light sensors. The Arduino Uno receives this information and determines that there is sufficient natural light present. As a result, it deactivates the streetlights, preventing unnecessary energy consumption. This intelligent system ensures that the streetlights remain off during the day, saving electricity and promoting energy efficiency in urban lighting infrastructure.

This image shows the nighttime situation.During nighttime, the Automatic Streetlight System using Arduino Uno detects the low ambient light levels through the light sensors. The Arduino Uno receives this information and determines that it is dark outside. As a result, it activates the streetlights, providing illumination for improved visibility and safety. This automated system ensures that the streetlights turn on automatically at night, enhancing convenience and security in the urban environment.


# **Project 2:SAFER PEDESTRIAN CROSSING USING ARDUINO UNO**
The safer pedestrian crossing using Arduino Uno is a system designed to enhance pedestrian safety at crosswalks especially during nights. It utilizes an Arduino Uno board, a photo sensor, and traffic signal lights. The photo sensor detects the traffic signal lights and during the pedestrian corssing time green light is made vertical towards the road and during other times red light is made horizontal to the road making pedistrains aware its not theier time to cross.This Arduino-based solution aims to prevent accidents and create a safer environment for pedestrians and drivers alike.![Screenshot (43)](https://github.com/nejinjoshy/TinkercadProjects/assets/117255470/251ebd85-57e1-456f-8449-9ca3eb36b393)![Screenshot (42)](https://github.com/nejinjoshy/TinkercadProjects/assets/117255470/3b8c2eee-e0fb-4482-a72d-0d12eded064b)
